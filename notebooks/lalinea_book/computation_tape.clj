;; # Computation tape

;; dtype-next's laziness is useful but opaque. When you chain
;; operations like `la/add`, `la/scale`, and `la/transpose`, it is
;; not obvious which results share memory, which are lazy, and where
;; copies happen. The tape namespace provides tools to answer these
;; questions.

;; ## Setup

            [scicloj.lalinea.tensor :as t]
            [scicloj.lalinea.elementwise :as elem]
            [scicloj.lalinea.tape :as tape]

;; ## Inspecting memory status

;; `tape/memory-status` classifies a tensor's memory backing without
;; needing a tape. Three states:
;;
;; - `:contiguous` — backed by a `double[]`, fast, mutable
;; - `:strided` — shares a `double[]` but with reordered strides
;; - `:lazy` — no backing array, recomputes on each access

(def A (t/matrix [[1 2] [3 4]]))

(tape/memory-status A)

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [s] (= :contiguous s))])

;; `la/transpose` returns a strided view — same backing data,
;; different stride order.

(tape/memory-status (la/transpose A))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [s] (= :strided s))])

;; `la/add` returns a lazy reader — no allocation, recomputes
;; on every access.

(def B (t/matrix [[5 6] [7 8]]))

(tape/memory-status (la/add A B))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [s] (= :lazy s))])

;; `la/mmul` goes through EJML and returns a fresh contiguous tensor.

(tape/memory-status (la/mmul A B))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [s] (= :contiguous s))])

;; ## Memory relation
;;
;; `tape/memory-relation` classifies the relationship between
;; two tensors:
;;
;; - `:shared` — same backing `double[]`
;; - `:independent` — separate backing arrays
;; - `:unknown-lazy` — at least one is lazy; relationship indeterminate

;; A matrix and its transpose share backing memory:

(tape/memory-relation A (la/transpose A))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [r] (= :shared r))])

;; Two separate matrices are independent:

(tape/memory-relation A B)

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [r] (= :independent r))])

;; Two `t/column` calls on the same `double[]` share memory:

(def arr (double-array [10 20 30]))

(tape/memory-relation (t/column arr) (t/column arr))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [r] (= :shared r))])

;; A lazy result (from `la/add`) actually reads through to its
;; inputs on every access — but without a tape, dtype-next does
;; not expose that dependency chain:

(tape/memory-relation A (la/add A B))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [r] (= :unknown-lazy r))])

;; With a tape, `detect-memory-status` gives the complete answer.
;; It knows the inputs of each operation, so it can report
;; `:reads-through` instead of `:unknown-lazy`:

(let [tr (tape/with-tape
           (let [M (t/matrix [[1 2] [3 4]])
                 S (la/add M M)]
             S))]
  (tape/detect-memory-status (last (:entries tr))))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [s] (= :reads-through s))])

;; ## Recording a computation tape

;; `tape/with-tape` records all `la/`, `cx/`, and `elem/` operations within its scope.
;; It returns `{:result ... :entries ...}`.

(def tape-result
  (tape/with-tape

;; The result is a map with `:result` (the computed value) and
;; `:entries` (the recorded operations). Each entry tracks the
;; operation, its inputs (linked by ID or marked `:external`),
;; and the output shape.

;; ## External inputs

;; The tape tracks `la/`, `cx/`, and `elem/` operations. Inputs that
;; originate outside La Linea (raw arrays, Clojure data structures,
;; `dfn/` results, EJML objects) appear as `{:external true}`.

;; ### Double arrays

;; A `double[]` passed to `t/column` is external — the tape
;; records `t/column` but not the array construction.

(def array-tape
  (tape/with-tape
    (let [v (t/column [1 2 3])

;; ### Clojure vectors and sequences

;; Clojure data structures are external too. `t/matrix` wraps
;; them into tensors — the tape records that wrapping.

(def seq-tape

;; ### dtype-next operations

;; Using `la/mul` instead of raw `dfn/*` means the tape captures
;; the full chain. The `t/matrix` wrapper around the result is also
;; recorded.

(def dfn-tape

      (:entries dfn-tape))

;; `la/mul` computes the element-wise product, and `t/matrix` wraps
;; its result. All four operations (`t/matrix`, `la/mul`, `t/matrix`,
;; `la/add`) are tracked on the tape.

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [entries]
    (= [:t/matrix :la/mul :t/matrix :la/add]
       (mapv :op entries)))])

;; ### EJML structures

;; EJML's `DMatrixRMaj` can be converted to a tensor via
;; `t/dmat->tensor`. The conversion itself is not instrumented
;; (it is a low-level interop function), so the resulting tensor
;; is external to the tape.

(def ejml-tape
  (tape/with-tape
    (let [dm (doto (DMatrixRMaj. 2 2)
               (.setData (double-array [1 0 0 1])))
          I  (t/dmat->tensor dm)
          result (la/add (t/matrix [[5 6] [7 8]]) I)]
      result)))

(mapv (fn [e] (select-keys e [:id :op :inputs]))

;; to `la/add`.

;; ## Complex operations

;; `cx/` operations are recorded alongside `la/` operations. The tape
;; shows the full chain: `t/matrix` → `cx/complex-tensor` → `la/add`.

(def complex-tape
  (tape/with-tape
    (let [z1 (cx/complex-tensor (t/matrix [[1 0] [0 1]]))
          z2 (cx/complex-tensor (t/matrix [[0 1] [1 0]]))

;; When `la/add` dispatches to `cx/add` for complex inputs, only the
;; outermost operation is recorded — the tape shows `:la/add`, not
;; both `:la/add` and `:cx/add`.
;;
;; Calling `cx/add` directly records as `:cx/add`:

(mapv :op (:entries (tape/with-tape
                      (cx/add (cx/complex-tensor [1 2])
                              (cx/complex-tensor [3 4])))))

;; ## Tape summary

;; `tape/summary` aggregates statistics about the tape:
;; operation counts and memory status breakdown.

(tape/summary tape-result)

(kind/test-last [(fn [s] (= 6 (:total s)))])

;; The summary shows:
;;
;; - `:by-op` — one of each operation
;; - `:by-memory` — which operations read through, share memory, or are independent

;; ## Origin [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)

;; `tape/origin` walks the tape backwards from a value
;; to reconstruct its computation DAG.

(tape/origin tape-result (:result tape-result))

;; The DAG shows that `mmul` depends on `add` and `transpose`,
;; which both trace back to the original `matrix`. The shared
;; reference to `matrix` appears as `{:ref "t1"}` in the
;; transpose branch — a proper DAG, not a tree.

;; ## Mermaid visualization

;; `tape/mermaid` renders the DAG as a [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) flowchart.
;; Memory status annotations:
;;
;; - `~` reads-through (lazy, recomputes on access from inputs)
;; - `=` shared (same backing array as an input)
;; - `+` independent (fresh allocation)

(tape/mermaid tape-result (:result tape-result))

;; materialized and what is lazy?"
